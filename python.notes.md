# Software: Python & CircuitPython

*Python & CircuitPython are relatives.*

(*Father* :construction_worker:) - **Python** is simple text & made to be spoken. It doesn't use crazy symbols either. 

<img src="images/eye.down.png" width="10%" />  Can you read this aloud? 

```
if number > 500:
   print('Your number is greater than 500.')
else:
   print('Your number is less than 500.')
```

You're on :fire:



- Python is popular & used for web pages and apps.  :trollface:  

(*Baby* :baby:) - **CircuitPython** is used with NeoTrellis.

### Step #1: Install Python 

- It works on all computers, but it doesn'y always come on all computers.

### Step #2: Install Thonny


 
-There is a list of tutorials suitable for experienced programmers on the BeginnersGuide/Tutorials page.
-Online documentation is your first port of call for definitive information. There are simple, short tutorials and more complicated ones. Keep looking for whatever you like the best.
-Python is Open Source Software which means it's free for anyone to use, modify or improve upon.
-CircuitPython supports small micro-devices without much "power" or "ram." 

- CircuitPython is easy to use because all you need is that little board, a USB cable, and a computer with a USB connection.
- 
-Python is taught in many schools. 

-CircuitPython is almost-completely compatible with Python. It simply adds hardware support.

# CircuitPython

CircuitPython is a simplified version of Python. It works with microcontrollers. 

Simply copy and edit files on the flash drive named CIRCUITPY which appears when NeoTrellis is plugged into a computer to iterate.

The following instructions will show you how to install CircuitPython. If you've already installed CircuitPython but are looking to update it or reinstall it, the same steps work for that as well!

Click the link above and download the latest UF2 file.

Download and save it to your desktop (or any folder).

Plug your NeoTrellis M4 Express into your computer using a known-good USB cable.

A lot of people end up using charge-only USB cables and it is very frustrating! So make sure you have a USB cable you know is good for data sync.

Double-click the Reset button next to the USB connector on your board, and you will see the status DotStar RGB LED turn green. If it turns red, check the USB cable, try another USB port, etc.

If double-clicking doesn't work the first time, try again. Sometimes it can take a few tries to get the rhythm right!

You will see a new flash disk drive appear called TRELM4BOOT.

Drag the adafruit_circuitpython_etc.uf2 file to TRELM4BOOT.

The LED will flash. Then, the TRELM4BOOT drive will disappear and a new disk drive called CIRCUITPY will appear.

That's it, you're on :fire:! 

You can then unzip this download and drag the files onto CIRCUITPY drive to get back to the default drum machine
